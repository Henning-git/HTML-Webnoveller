        <h3 class="headh3">Sunny "Lost From Light"</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Sunless, or “Sunny,” is the scrappy, street-born survivor from the neglected outskirts—a patchwork of shadows, grit, and survival instincts. Before the Nightmare Spell touched him, he was locked in a daily struggle, navigating betrayal, hunger, and at best, fleeting safety. Everything changes when the Spell infects him—either the Dream Realm devours you, or you come back changed. Against all odds, Sunny survives, and in doing so, awakens to forbidden power born from shadows. The person who emerges is still lean, pale, and haunted by the past, but his eyes now glitter with cold resolve: he will not just survive, but push forward. Each Nightmare hones him—he becomes cunning, adaptable, and deeply aware that every gain carries a cost, every ability a weakness. He learns to trust cautiously, to deceive expertly, and to fight by weaving shadows into tools of survival. But beneath the driven tactics and grim determination beats a heart that resists becoming a monster—he craves connection, meaning, and the faint glimmer of redemption. In essence, Sunny is less a hero and more a wounded soul forged by nightmare, rising through pain and power, step by laborious step, toward something greater than mere existence.</p>

        <h3 class="headh3">Nephis "Changing Star"</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Nephis, known as Changing Star, is a tall young woman with silvery-white hair and calm gray eyes that give her a distant, almost untouchable aura. She carries herself with quiet confidence, a blend of grace and resolve. As the last heir of the Immortal Flame Clan, she bears a heavy legacy shaped by early loss and betrayal, which left her distrustful of others and reliant on her own strength. Her Aspect is tied to fire and light, granting her the ability to burn or heal with soul flame, though each use inflicts severe pain. Nephis is determined to face every Nightmare and unravel the Nightmare Spell, pursuing this goal with unwavering willpower. Although she often appears cold, her actions reveal a strict personal code and a hidden sense of responsibility. Skilled in both swordplay and strategy, she does not lead for glory but because failure is not an option. Nephis is a figure of quiet intensity, hardened by hardship yet still carrying a trace of humanity beneath her calm exterior.</p>

        <h3 class="headh3">Cassie</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Cassie is a blind Seeker whose presence balances quiet fragility with surprising strength. Her long blonde hair and sightless eyes give her a delicate appearance, yet her calm demeanor and steady words often ground those around her. Though she cannot see, she perceives the world in her own way, moving with a confidence that belies her condition. Cassie is thoughtful and perceptive, able to read people’s emotions and intentions with remarkable clarity. She brings warmth to her companions through kindness and loyalty, offering support when others falter. Her blindness has forced her to develop patience and resilience, qualities that make her contributions all the more valuable in dangerous trials. While she lacks the imposing power of some, her insight and courage allow her to stand alongside them as an equal. Cassie’s strength lies not in physical force but in her inner resolve and the quiet light she provides in dark moments.</p>
