            <p class="paragraph"><strong style="font-size: 22.5px;">Sunless</strong>, or “Sunny,” is the scrappy, street-born survivor from the neglected outskirts, a figure pieced together from shadows, grit, and sheer instinct. Before the Nightmare Spell touched him, his life was one of betrayal, hunger, and fleeting safety, where every day was a new test of endurance. That harsh beginning left him sharp-minded and wary, but also strangely resilient in spirit. When the Spell infects him, the challenge becomes far greater, yet Sunny adapts with the same tenacity that once kept him alive on the streets. He learns to shape shadows into strength, to trust no one too easily, and to guard his heart against despair.Still, his resolve shines through in cold determination: he will push forward, no matter how heavy the cost.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong style="font-size: 22.5px;">Nephis</strong>, called the Changing Star, stands tall with silver hair and gray eyes that make her seem distant, almost untouchable. She is the last heir of the Immortal Flame Clan, carrying a weight of history marked by betrayal and loss, and so she relies on no one but herself. Her Aspect ties her to fire and light, gifts that allow her to both burn away her enemies and heal the wounded, though every use of power tears at her body with cruel intensity. Outwardly calm and composed, she hides the sharp edge of a soul hardened by trial, and her quiet strength often inspires those who walk beside her. Though she seldom reveals what lies beneath her mask of control, she is not without compassion, only careful in when to show it.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong style="font-size: 22.5px;">Cassie</strong>, carries herself with gentle grace, her blind eyes giving the impression of fragility, while in truth she possesses remarkable strength of spirit. She moves through the world without sight, yet she perceives far more than others realize, listening closely to the currents of emotion and intent that ripple around her. Her quiet voice often brings comfort, and her calm manner steadies companions in moments of doubt or fear. Though she does not wield the same overwhelming power as some, her insight and courage make her indispensable in any trial. Cassie’s patience is born from hardship, and her resilience has been sharpened by a life that demands adaptation.</p>
